what needs to be done:

client.cloudwatch.py is a skelleton of what needs to be done.

credentials should be moved to a settings.ini file and it should be in gitignore

monitoring.tables.sql has the structure of mysql tables that need to accept this data
each instance that is monitored should be entered in the `instance` table, and all of its metrics be related by a foreign key

settings.ini should also have an option for specifying start and end dates.
it should also have an array of instance names. Currently it's just one instance '' and it's hardcoded
please change that.

In the current implementation, there is no pagination. Please implement it.

last, but not least, here is the list of metrics that we need to get:

CPUUtilization		
DiskQueueDepth		
DatabaseConnections	
FreeableMemory		
FreeStorageSpace	
ReadIOPS			
WriteIOPS			
ReadLatency			
WriteLatency		
ReplicaLag			

DDLLatency
SelectLatency
InsertLatency
DeleteLatency
UpdateLatency
Deadlocks
BufferCacheHitRatio
